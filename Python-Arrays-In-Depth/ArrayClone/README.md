# Array-Clone

The array structure is commonly found in most programming languages as a primitive type, but Python only provides the list structure for creating mutable sequences. We can define the Array ADT to represent a one-dimensional array for
use in Python that works similarly to arrays found in other languages. It will be used throughout this project when an array structure is required.

## One-Dimensional Array
It is a collection of contiguous elements in which individual
elements are identified by a unique integer subscript starting with zero. Once an
array is created, its size cannot be changed.

This project will host a One dimensional array created to mimic the behavior of arrays in other programming Languages

Comments are provided to highlight the use of the operator methods

We will be making use of the "ctypes module" to implement our array abstract data type(ADT)
